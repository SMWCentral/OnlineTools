    <h2>Info</h2>
    <p>This tool can be used to convert MML syntax into raw SFX hex bytes. While AddmusicK technically supports MML for sound effects, historically, it's been prone to being super buggy, so it's better to write raw hex, which is also incredibly tedious and hard-to-parse for anything remotely complex. This tool bridges that gap; you can write MML, which is then converted into hex bytes you can paste into AMK directly, without having to go through the tedium of raw hex.</p>
    <p>    
        The following subset of MML syntax is accepted. Do note that SFX has some additional restrictions, which are noted in <span class="red">red</span>.
        <ul>
            <li>Notes (<span class="monospace">abcdefg</span>), sharps and flats (<span class="monospace">+</span> and <span class="monospace">-</span>, respectively), and note lengths (both regular and in ticks (<span class="monospace">=</span>)). <span class="red">SFX note lengths cannot be longer than $7F (127) ticks. Ties (<span class="monospace">^</span> and <span class="monospace">.</span>) are unsupported.</span></li>
            <li>The <span class="monospace">o</span>, <span class="monospace"><</span>, and <span class="monospace">></span> commands. <span class="red">Valid range: <span class="monospace">o1c</span>-<span class="monospace">o6a</span></span>.</li>
            <li>The <span class="monospace">@</span> command. See the <span class="monospace">SFXInstrumentTable</span> label in <span class="monospace">asm\InstrumentData.asm</span> for instrument listings. <span class="red">Valid range: <span class="monospace">@0</span>-<span class="monospace">@127</span>. Note that this is an AddmusicK restriction.</span></li>
            <li>The <span class="monospace">n</span> command. This command sets a noise instrument, and can take one or two values (separated by a comma (<span class="monospace">,</span>)). The first parameter is the pitch of noise to use, <span class="red">with the valid range being <span class="monospace">n00</span>-<span class="monospace">n1F</span></span>. The optional second parameter defines an instrument number to get ADSR values from.</li>
            <li>The <span class="monospace">l</span> command. Note that, unlike AMK's regular parser, this tool supports tick values for this command (ex. <span class="monospace">l=24</span>, which would be equivalent to <span class="monospace">l8</span>).</li>
            <li>The <span class="monospace">h</span> command, with positive and negative decimal values. This will shift all notes by the given amount of semitones. For example: <span class="monospace">h2</span>, <span class="monospace">h0</span>, or <span class="monospace">h-3</span>. Do note that the shift will also apply to any notes in pitch bend commands.</li>
            <li>The <span class="monospace">v</span> command. This command sets volume, and can take one or two values (separated by a comma (<span class="monospace">,</span>)). If one value is provided, both the left and right channels are set to this volume (ex. <span class="monospace">v35</span> will set both the left and right volumes to 35 ($23)). If two values are provided, the left channel's volume is set to the first value, and the right channel's volume is set to the second value (ex. <span class="monospace">v65,100</span> sets the left volume to 65 ($41), and the right volume to 100 ($64)). This effectively replaces panning, and so there is no separate <span class="monospace">y</span> command. <span class="red">Valid range: <span class="monospace">v0</span>-<span class="monospace">v127</span></span></li>
            <li>Pitch bends, denoted with <span class="monospace">$DD$WW$XX$YY$ZZ</span> and <span class="monospace">$EB$XX$YY$ZZ</span>. See <a href="https://smwc.me/1546244">this thread</a> for information on these commands. Note that, like in regular MML syntax, you can replace the bytes in these commands with notes alongside <span class="monospace"><</span> and <span class="monospace">></span>. However, <span class="red">you cannot mix and match hex bytes and notes/octave changes, nor use the <span class="monospace">o</span> command for octave changes.</span> Examples of valid syntax: <span class="monospace">$DD $A4 $03 $03 $A8</span>, <span class="monospace">$DD c $03 $03 >b</span>, <span class="monospace">$DD &gt;e- $03 $12 &lt;&lt;g+</span>, <span class="monospace">$EB $00 $06 g+</span>, <span class="monospace">$EB $12 $0C $B9</span>.</li>
        </ul>
        Other commands available in regular AMK MML, such as <span class="monospace">t</span>, <span class="monospace">w</span>, <span class="monospace">y</span>, <span class="monospace">q</span>, or <span class="monospace">p</span>, do not work in sound effects.
    </p>
    <p>You can also set priority for the sound effect by inputting a number <span class="red">between 0 and 255</span>. The higher the value, the higher priority the sound effect has compared to other sound effects; i.e., if two sound effects are to play over each other, the one with higher priority takes precedence. <span class="red">This command is only supported in AddmusicK 1.0.9 and up.</span></p>
    <p>By design, any values that are out of bounds for a given range (ex. an octave being too high, or an invalid volume value) throw a warning (which appears at the bottom), and are then clamped to be within the correct range (ex. a note in <span class="monospace">o7</span> would be rounded down to <span class="monospace">o6</span>) before the hex bytes are generated.<br>
    If the parser otherwise encounters something it can't decipher, it'll be returned as a <span class="monospace">?</span> in the output, which should hopefully help pinpoint where the mistake is.</p><br>
